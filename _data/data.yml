        During my MSc. research journey, I have developed a tool for designing/discovering novel drug candidate molecules using AI (Graph Neural Networks, and Deep Reinforcement Learning) by developing an extension for the soft-actor-critic alogorthm to operate on molecular graphs, and to handle multi-discrete action space.
        Also, I have produce three high impacted papers.
